## Which GraphQL server approach should I use?

Points to consider in both GraphQL-first and Code-first approaches

- GraphQL-first has the advantage to be up-to-date with newest GraphQL features while with Code-first usually there might be a delay until the feature is supported
- GraphQL-first needs to be mapped to Typescript typing
- Code-first solutions usually handle a lot of things behind the scenes, it's amazing when it works, but a real pain to debug and understand when it doesn't
